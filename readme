📋 Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

A Palmetto account and an active session on a compute node.

A requirements.txt file in your project directory containing:

Plaintext
langchain
langchain-ollama
langchain-community
pandas
httpx
🛠️ Initial Installation
Run the setup script to build your isolated Python 3.10 environment in the 5TB /scratch zone. This keeps your /home directory clean and avoids quota issues.

Give permission to the setup file:

Bash
chmod +x setup_research.sh
Run the setup:

Bash
./setup_research.sh
Note: This script automatically loads anaconda3/2023.09-0 and creates the environment at /scratch/$USER/persona_env.

⚡ Quick Access (Daily Use)
You don't need to run the setup script every time. Once the environment is built, use this shortcut to enter it instantly.

1. Set up the Alias (Run Once)
Run this command once to create the start_persona shortcut in your bash configuration:

Bash
echo "alias start_persona='module load anaconda3/2023.09-0 && source activate /scratch/\$USER/persona_env'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
2. Activate Environment
Whenever you log in to a compute node, simply type:

Bash
start_persona
You will know it worked when your terminal prompt starts with (/scratch/yourname/persona_env).

Now the system uses OPP-115 dataset, please download it by yourself.
