## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. A **Palmetto account** and access to a compute node.
2. A `requirements.txt` file in your project directory containing:
```text
langchain
langchain-ollama
langchain-community
pandas
httpx
```

## 🛠️ Initial Installation

Run the setup script to build your isolated Python 3.10 environment in the 5TB `/scratch` zone.

1. **Give permission to setup file**
```bash
chmod +x setup_research.sh
```

2. **Run the setup:**
```bash
./setup_research.sh

```

> **Note:** This script automatically loads `anaconda3/2023.09-0` and creates the environment at `/scratch/$USER/persona_env`.

---

## ⚡ Quick Access (Daily Use)

You don't need to run the setup script every time. To enter the environment quickly, add a shortcut to your system.

### 1. Set up the Alias

Run this command **once** to create the `start_persona` shortcut:

```bash
echo "alias start_persona='module load anaconda3/2023.09-0 && source activate /scratch/\$USER/persona_env'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

### 2. Activate Environment

Whenever you log in to a compute node, simply type:

```bash
start_persona

```

Now the system uses OPP-115 dataset, please download it by yourself.
